Adding the SDK library to your project

* After successfully creating a new Android project or opening an existing one, the next thing that needs to be done
  is adding the Chute SDK as a library.
* Chute SDK project can be found and downloaded at [https://github.com/chute/photo-picker-plus/tree/master/Android/SDK](https://github.com/chute/photo-picker-plus/tree/master/Android/SDK). Or visit [http://developer.getchute.com/](http://developer.getchute.com/) for more info.

- You can add Chute SDK library either by:
* Coping the jar file located in target/ directory of the Chute SDK library project into libs/ directory or your project
  or
* adding Chute SDK library project in your project's build path by selecting Properties -> Java Build Path -> Add

Android manifest setup
====

* Open the AndroidManifest.xml file 

* Add the following permissions that are required for the Chute SDK:

    ```
        Standard Permission to access the internet
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET" />
        Permission for caching the images on the SD card
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
        The following permissions are used by chute to track the phone id and version to determine the device used for managing the uploads and users
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
        Used for the http request service for the long running uploads.
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />
    ```

Apart from registering your own components in the manifest, you will need to add the following service and activity also:

* Register HttpServiceExecutorService:

    ```
        <service android:name="com.dg.libs.rest.services.HTTPRequestExecutorService" />
    ```
 
* Register AuthenticationActivity from Chute SDK:

    ```
        <activity android:name="com.chute.sdk.api.v2.authentication.GCAuthenticationActivity" />
    ```
