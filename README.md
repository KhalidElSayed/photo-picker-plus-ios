# Important

There has been a complete rework of the PhotoPicker component. If you are using the old legacy code you can find it in the pp-v1-legacy branch.

Read the documentation and migrate to the new version of the Photo Picker.
Each platform component contains the Library and a Sample Project which you can use as a reference.

You will find more details on the implementation in the Readme.md for each component.
